# Swift Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common Swift error: a type mismatch in function arguments. The `calculateArea` function expects integer inputs for width and height, but the provided code attempts to pass a String to the height parameter.  This leads to a compile-time error because Swift's strong type system enforces type safety.

The solution shows how to correctly pass integer values to the function to avoid the type mismatch error.
